    Medehamstede, or Peterborough as we know it now, was guessed to have first been formed between 44-48AD for the housing of a roman legion.<br>
    It became known as Burgh in the 10th Century, but wasn't a borough until the 12th Century.<br>
    The Cathedral, which it is mainly known for, began construction around 655AD and was completed around 1287AD. It also contains the burial sites of Catherine of Aragon and Mary Queen of Scots.
